[Mentor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=faubulous.mentor) is an extension for 
Visual Studio Code, which is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. 
The super power of VS Code is its extensibility through its vast ecosystem of extensions, which allow 
3rd party developers to add new features and functionality to the IDE. At this time, the

various programming languages and tasks.

### About Telemetry
Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve the product while Mentor does not collect any personal data or usage information. You can disable the VS Code telemetry entirely in the settings or use VSCodium as a privacy-respecting alternative.
