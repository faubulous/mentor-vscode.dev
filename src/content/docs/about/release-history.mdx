### Version 0.3.8
<span class="codicon codicon-calendar"></span> *5th January 2026*

🎉 Happy New Year!

This service release fixes the following bugs:

- Broken auto-complete support.
- Missing refresh icon in SPARQL boolean query results.
- `:` prefixes in files are now implemented as `workspace:` URIs instead of `file:` to improve portability.

It also adds a link to mentor-vscode.dev for help and documentation.

### Version 0.3.7
<span class="codicon codicon-calendar"></span> *22nd December 2025*

Improves the way sh:path is handled when displaying nodes in the definition tree. In previous versions the
tree always preferred displaying sh:path as a node name if present. Now it respects the order of the the
predicates defined in `mentor.predicates.labels` setting. Also, `sh:name` was added to the default list with
a higher priority than `sh:path`, allowing you to define custom labels more easily.

Fixes refresh button not visible in toolbar for boolean SPARQL results.

### Version 0.3.6
<span class="codicon codicon-calendar"></span> *5th December 2025*

This version addresses a bug that caused missing result values or unbound variables in SPARQL query results, missing navigation icons in the bindings table.

### Version 0.3.2
<span class="codicon codicon-calendar"></span> *14th November 2025*

This version fixes a bug where cyclic rdfs:subClassOf definitions caused an infinite recursion error. It also implements an improved Mentor RDF API that handles the retrieval of resources more efficiently and faster then previous versions.

### Version 0.3.1
<span class="codicon codicon-calendar"></span> *14th October 2025*

This version adds support for executing SPARQL queries against SPARQL endpoints and the internal Mentor workspace. This is a pre-release version to test the extensive changes before an actual release.

### Version 0.2.11
Fixes a stack overflow bug when browsing ontologies with recursive class definitions. Meanwhile work on support for SPARQL queries and notebooks for 0.3.0 is progressing.

### Version 0.2.9
This release adds support for reference browsing, code lenses, renaming and hover tooltips for RDF/XML files.

### Version 0.2.8
This release adds initial support for [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) documents. This includes browsing definitions and tooltips for IRIs in files that have an `.rdf` extension. The next release will add support for reference / usage information, codelenses ~~and conversion into Turtle~~.

### Version 0.2.7
Fixed two bugs and cleaned up the internal structure of the definition tree code for better maintainability and extensibility. Please report any issues that might occur with the defintion tree after this update.

1. Selecting an individual in the tree now jumps to it's definition instead of the first reference. This behavior is now consistent with the way this works for classes, properties and other definitions.
2. Improved support for cycles in sub-class relation ships.

Next release is planned add suport RDF/XML.

### Version 0.2.6
Fixed two minor issues:

1. Auto declaration of prefixes is disabled when manually declaring prefixes in the file header. The auto-implement kicked-in as soon as the ':' was typed and began to resort the prefix definitions without moving the cursor. The new default behavior now is to not run the auto-implement command when manually declaring prefixes.

2. PNAME_NS tokens are now considered for reference counting if they are not part of a prefix declaration. In previous versions of Mentor these tokens were not counted as usages of the namespace and thus lead to invalid markings of namespaces as unused when the namespace prefix was used without a local part.

### Version 0.2.5
This release introduces support for selecting the language tags to display in the definition tree. This ensures a consistent view of definitions across the definition tree and editor tooltips, which typically show labels and definitions in the currently selected language. Additionally, items in the definition tree without language-tagged labels can now be highlighted.

### Version 0.2.3
Fixed a bug where the definition tree would ignore the settings for resource labels and initially only show the URI local part instead of annotated labels.

### Version 0.2.2
This release adds editor functions to automatically define / implement missing prefix definitions in the document. The namespace IRIs for a prefix are looked up in other documents in the workspace first and if not found, are retreived from a local copy of [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc). The editor also now highights unused prefix definitions and marks them as inactive similar to the behavior of unused imports in other programming languages. Duplicate prefix defintions are marked as a warning. Also some new refactoring methods for prefixes were added:

- Sort prefix definitions in the document header
- Remove unused prefix definitions
- Turn IRI references into prefixed names

There are new settings to adjust the prefix implementation behavior. Prefixes can be implemented by maintaing a sorted list of prefixes at the top of the document (default), or by appending the new prixes after the last prefix defintion. The auto-implementation of prefixes can also be turned off entirely.

Finally this release includes a fix, that addresses a bug caused by the Millan parser that sometimes includes trailing whitespaces in tokens where it should not. Now the find reference command has a more reliable highlighting of the prefix name or IRI.

### Version 0.2.1
This release supports browsing SHACL shapes that are defined in ontologies. You can quickly jump to shape definitions that are associated with classes or properties from the definitions tree. Also supports SHACL datatype definitions for properties.

Greatly improved workspace indexing speed for reference resolution with added options for skipping files above a configurable size limit.

Mentor can be run as a pure web extension and supports collaboration in online portals such as [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).
