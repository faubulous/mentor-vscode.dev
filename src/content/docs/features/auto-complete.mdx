Mentor offers comprehensive auto-completion support for RDF languages, including SPARQL and RDF data. 
This feature enhances productivity by providing real-time suggestions for terms, 
helping users write accurate queries while minimizing errors caused by invalid or unknown terms.

## Resolution Strategy
The auto-complete system lists all known subjects, predicates, and objects defined in the 
currently edited namespace, enabling you to quickly access relevant RDF terms without memorizing them.
The namespaces are resolved according to the definitions in the current document and support
looking up terms that are defined in other documents in the workspace. 

The following resolution order applies:

1. **Document**: Suggestions from the current document are prioritised for immediate relevance.
2. **Workspace / Standards**: If no matches are found in the local document, Mentor extends suggestions to other files in the workspace or standard RDF vocabularies.

This priority system ensures that you receive the most contextually appropriate suggestions first.

<Aside type="tip" title="Triple Context Awareness">
Mentor’s auto-complete functionality is context-aware, providing suggestions based on the 
position of the cursor within the currently edited RDF triple:

- **Subjects / Objects:** When the cursor is on a subject or object, Mentor lists all subjects or objects defined within the namespace.
- **Predicates:** When the cursor is on a triple predicate, Mentor lists all relevant predicates available in the corresponding namespace and falls back to subjects if none are found.
