[Code Lenses](https://vscode.rocks/codelens/) are a powerful feature in Visual Studio Code 
that allows you to display contextual information and actions directly within code. Mentor
currently provides code lenses to display usage information and SPARQL connections.

## Usages Lens
The Usages Lens displays all the places where a particular resource is used within the 
workspace. With *usage* we are referring to all occurrences of a resource URI in either 
RDF data files or SPARQL queries.

This lens helps you understand the impact of changes to a resource and facilitates 
refactoring by providing a comprehensive view of its usage. When you click on a usage lens,
a reference search is triggered, showing all occurrences in the workspace.

<Aside type="note" title="Usage Count Calculation">
The number that is displayed in the Usage Lens is the total number of occurrences of the resource
URI (prefixed name or full URI) in the workspace minus one. This means that a resource that is 
only defined but not used anywhere else will show up as having zero usages.

## Connections Lens
The Connections Lens displays the SPARQL endpoint the query or notebook cell will be executed
against. When clicking on the lens you will be presented with a list of configured SPARQL
connections to choose from.

Please refer to the [SPARQL Query](/features/sparql-query) documentation for more details.
