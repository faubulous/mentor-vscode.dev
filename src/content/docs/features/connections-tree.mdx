The Connections Tree provides a view of all SPARQL connections that can be used 
to issue queries. These SPARQL connections can be selected in query files
or Mentor notebooks to execute queries against local or remote endpoints.

## Title Bar
The tree view is titled 'Connections' and enables the management of connections to SPARQL endpoints.

### Primary Actions
The connections tree offers several actions that are visible as icons in the title bar:

<div class="table-30ch">
| Action | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| <span class="codicon codicon-plus icon-inline"></span> *Add Connection* | Configure a new SPARQL connection. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-refresh icon-inline"></span> *Refresh Tree* | Manually refreshes the connections tree. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-collapse-all icon-inline"></span> *Collapse / Expand All* | Collapse or Expand all nodes in the connections tree. |
</div>

## Connection Scope
The tree displays two types of connections, **User** and **Workspace**.

<div class="table-20ch">
| Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| **User** | User connections are only available to the current user and are typically stored on the user's local machine. |
| **Workspace** | Workspace connections are stored in the .vscode directory and can thus be shared with other users in version controlled repositories. |
</div>

## Editing Connections
When you select an existing connection in the tree view or when you click on the 'Add Connection' icon in the title bar, 
the connection details will be displayed in an editor pane. From here, you can modify the connection settings, such as the 
SPARQL endpoint URL, authentication credentials, and other parameters. Once you have made your changes, you can save them 
to update the connection.

<Aside type="note" title="Workspace Connection">
The workspace is a special SPARQL endpoint that gives you access to [Mentor's internal RDF triple store](/features/workspace-index/#generated-graphs). The data in this
store is recreated every time you open a new workspace and this connection cannot be deleted. It can be queried from
[SPARQL files](/features/sparql-query/) and [Mentor notebooks](/features/mentor-notebooks/).
</Aside>

### Supported Authentication Methods
The following authentication methods are supported for SPARQL connections:

| Type | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| **None** | No authentication. |
| **Basic** | Basic HTTP(s) authentication using a username and password. |
| **Bearer Token** | Authentication using a bearer token. |
| **Microsoft Entra** | Authentication using Microsoft Entra ID provider that is built into Visual Studio Code. |

## Testing Connections
Once you have configured a connection, you can test it to ensure that it is working correctly. To test a connection, follow these steps:

1. Select the connection you want to test in the connections tree.
2. Click on the <span class="codicon codicon-debug-disconnect icon-inline"></span> button in the editor pane.
3. The connection status will be displayed in the editor pane.

If the test fails, you may need to adjust the connection settings and try again.
