The Definitions Tree provides a hierarchical view of all RDF terms that are defined 
in the active document. It shows all subjects in the current document which are supported ontology 
or taxonomy types and enables you to quickly navigate to the definitions or execute commands.

## Tree Display
The following section describes the various aspects of how the Definitions Tree displays nodes 
and how to customise it to your needs.

### Node Labels
The displayed name of nodes in the definition tree is determined by looking for a configurable set of 
label predicates. This is the default option and referred to as 'Annotated Labels' in the tree view settings.

In this mode, the displayed labels also consider language tags, preferring labels that match the currently 
set active language which is indicated in the title section of the tree view. The active language can be 
changed by clicking on the language button in the tree title bar.

The predicates which are used for displaying the node labels can be configured in the [settings](#Settings). By 
default, Mentor uses the following preferred label predicates in order of priority:

- http://purl.org/dc/terms/title
- http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title
- http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel
- http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label
- https://schema.org/name
- http://schema.org/name
- http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#path

If no label can be found, the local name of the IRI is used as a fallback.

You can also choose to always display the local name of the IRI instead of looking for annotated labels, or to
display prefixed names if a prefix is declared for the namespace of the IRI. These options can be found in the `∙∙∙`
menu of the tree view.

### Definition Source Grouping
By default, the defined terms are grouped by the ontology or concept scheme they are part of. This 
is either determined by sharing a common namespace with an ontology header definition or by explicit 
`rdfs:isDefinedBy` annotations in the document. If no source of definition can be determined, the 
terms are grouped under `Unknown`. 

When available, the value of `owl:versionInfo` is also shown to indicate the version of an ontology.

There is also an option to turn-off grouping in the tree settings, which will show all defined terms
grouped by their type, regardless in which ontology / concept scheme they are defined.

## Ontology
The tree features support for common ontology types such as classes, properties, and 
individuals and specialised types from the OWL and SHACL vocabularies.

TODO

### OWL
To support correct display of subclass relationships, Mentor applies structural reasoning
to the ontology terms defined in the document. This means that if a class is defined as
an OWL restriction or equivalent class, Mentor will infer its subclass relationships
based on the OWL semantics.

TODO

### SHACL
The Definitions Tree also recognises SHACL shapes defined in the document. The tree provides
actions to navigate to shape definitions and displaying datatypes for property shapes.

TODO

## Taxonomy
The tree also supports SKOS terminology, such as concepts, concept schemes and collections. 
Similar to ontology terms, taxonomy terms are grouped by their source of definition, with 
an "Unknown" category for any terms that cannot be classified.

### SKOS

## Settings
The following settings can be used to configure the Definitions Tree:
