import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Mentor supports interactive notebooks that allow you to combine executable SPARQL queries, 
RDF data snippets and Markdown content for data science, query development and learning RDF.
Mentor notebooks have the file extension `.mnb`.

<Aside type="tip" title="Zero Setup Query">
What makes Mentor notebooks unique is a zero-setup approach: the 
[Workspace Index](/features/workspace-index) provides you a triple store at 
your fingertips without the need for any configuration. The data in this triple store can
be version-controlled, shared and published with ease using Git repositories.

## Creating Notebooks

There are multiple ways to create notebooks in Mentor:

 <source src="/screenshots/notebook-create.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

### From the Mentor View
<Steps title="From the Mentor View">
1. Select the <span class="mentor-icon mentor icon-inline"></span> Mentor icon in the sidebar.
1. Click on the <span class="codicon codicon-new-file icon-inline"></span> button in the tree view header of the [Workspace Tree](/features/workspace-tree).
1. Select "Mentor Notebook" from the list.
</Steps>

### From the Editor
<Steps title="From the Command Palette">
1. Open a SPARQL or RDF data file in the editor
1. Click on the <span class="codicon codicon-notebook icon-inline"></span> icon in the upper right corner of the editor
</Steps>

### From the Command Palette
<Steps title="From the Command Palette">
1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
1. Type "Create Notebook"
1. Select "Mentor: Create Notebook" from the dropdown
</Steps>

## Creating Cells
Mentor notebooks are implemented as native [Visual Studio Code Jupyter notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). You can create new cells by
either clicking on the <span class="button"><span class="codicon codicon-add icon-inline"></span> Code</span> or <span class="button"><span class="codicon codicon-add"></span> Markdown</span> buttons in the notebook toolbar
or by hovering at the bottom edge of existing cells:

<img class="screenshot" src="/screenshots/notebook-new.png" alt="Screenshot of a new Mentor Notebook"/>

The buttons in the toolbar append new cells to the notebook, while clicking on the buttons at the bottom edge 
of existing cells will create a new cell right below the hovered cell.

### Markdown
Markdown cells allow you to write rich text using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which allows you 
to add headings, lists, links, images, and more. It's an ideal format for structured text that focuses on content 
rather than presentation.

<img class="screenshot" src="/screenshots/notebook-cell-markdown.png" alt="Screenshot of a Markdown cell"/>

It is common practise to use Markdown cells for documenting competency questions the subsequent queries provide 
answers for. In general, documentation content of the notebooks should focus on the 'why' some modeling or queries
are structured the way they are instead of the 'how' which is usually covered by the code itself.

<Aside type="tip" title="Adding Diagrams">
Using the [Markdown Preview Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension, you can also add diagrams 
to your Markdown cells using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax.

### SPARQL Queries
SPARQL cells allow you to write and execute SPARQL queries against the Workspace Index or any connected 
SPARQL endpoint. To enable SPARQL cells, simply create a new code cell and select "SPARQL" as the cell language.

<img class="screenshot" src="/screenshots/notebook-cell-sparql.png" alt="Screenshot of a SPARQL cell"/>

All editor features are available within SPARQL cells, including syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and 
error checking. To execute a SPARQL cell, [select the connection](/features/sparql-query#select-connection) in the Code Lens located at the top
of the cell and click the <span class="codicon codicon-run icon-inline"></span> button in the cell toolbar.

### RDF Data
RDF Data cells allow you to write data in all [supported serialization formats](/features/syntax-highlighting#supported-formats).
To create an RDF Data cell, simply create a new code cell and select any of the RDF serialization formats as the cell language.

<Aside type="note" title="Referencing Data Cells">
In theory RDF data cells can be treated as ordinary documents in Visual Studio Code. This would
allow to reference the data of notebook cells from queries in any SPARQL query in the workspace.

**At the time of this writing, support for indexing notebook cell data is planned, but has not yet 
been implemented in Mentor.**
