Mentor supports interactive notebooks that allow you to combine executable SPARQL queries, 
RDF data snippets and Markdown content for data science, query development and learning RDF.
Mentor notebooks have the file extension `.mnb`.

<Aside type="note" title="Zero Setup Query">
What makes Mentor notebooks unique is a zero-setup approach: the 
[Workspace Index](/features/workspace-index) provides you a triple store at 
your fingertips without the need for any configuration. The data in this triple store can
be version-controlled, shared and published with ease using Git repositories.

## Creating Cells
Mentor notebooks are implemented as native [Visual Studio Code Jupyter notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). You can create new cells by
either clicking on the <span class="button"><span class="codicon codicon-add icon-inline"></span> Code</span> or <span class="button"><span class="codicon codicon-add"></span> Markdown</span> buttons in the notebook toolbar
or by hovering at the bottom edge of existing cells:

<img class="screenshot" src="/screenshots/notebook-new.png" alt="Screenshot of a new Mentor Notebook"/>

The buttons in the toolbar append new cells to the notebook, while clicking on the buttons at the bottom edge 
of existing cells will create a new cell right below the hovered cell.

### Markdown
Markdown cells allow you to write rich text using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which allows you 
to add headings, lists, links, images, and more. It's an ideal format for structured text that focuses on content 
rather than presentation.

It is common practise to use Markdown cells for documenting competency questions the subsequent queries provide 
answers for. In general, documentation content of the notebooks should focus on the 'why' some modeling or queries
are structured the way they are instead of the 'how' which is usually covered by the code itself.

<Aside type="tip" title="Adding Diagrams">
Using the [Markdown Preview Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension, you can also add diagrams 
to your Markdown cells using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax.
