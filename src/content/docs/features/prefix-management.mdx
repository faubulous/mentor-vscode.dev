One of the less convenient features of working with RDF data is the management of prefixes and namespaces. While
this feature enables the global disambiguation and alignment of terminology, looking up prefixes and their associated URIs is a
tedious and constantly repeating task. To save you time and effort, Mentor simplifies this process by automating 
prefix declaration and management where possible.

## Automatic Prefix Declaration
When you type a new prefix in an RDF document, Mentor will automatically implement the prefix declaration for you 
as soon as you insert a colon `:` character.

 <source src="/screenshots/auto-implement-prefixes.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

To determine which URI should be assigned to the prefix, Mentor consults the
[Workspace Index](/features/workspace-index) to look for existing prefix mappings in other documents. Preferring 
existing mappings over others will help you to keep the prefix definitions consistent across your project. Please
keep in mind that you should not redefine commonly used prefixes to avoid misunderstandings.

The preference of prefix lookups is as follows:

1. Mapping defined in the settings: `mentor.namespaces`
1. Existing prefix mappings in the Workspace Index
1. Community-contributed prefixes from the prefix.cc database

### prefix.cc Integration
If you start a new project, then you will not have any existing prefix mappings. To help you get started Mentor 
includes a copy of the [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc/) database. This database contains thousands of 
community-contributed RDF prefixes and their corresponding URIs and puts those definitions at your fingertips.

<Aside type="tip">
Providing the copy of the prefix.cc database allows Mentor to instantly lookup relevant prefix suggestions 
without the need for an internet connection and without causing lookup requests. However, this local database may 
not always have the most up-to-date information. 

To update the internal database, you can trigger a manual refresh
by using the command palette (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`) and selecting the `Update prefix definitions from prefix.cc` 
option.

## Quick Fixes
Mentor also provides editor features to help you organise and clean up existing prefix definitions in documents:

- `Implement missing prefixes`: Implements all undeclared prefixes that are used in the document.
- `Remove unused prefixes`: Removes all prefix declarations that are not used anywhere in the document. Unused prefix declarations are slightly shaded to indicate that they can be removed.
- `Sort prefixes`: Sorts all prefix declarations in the document according to the Mentor settings.

## Settings
The following settings can be used to configure the behaviour of the prefix management features:
