Refactoring refers to changing the structure of existing code without altering its functionality. 
It is a common process in software development. Therefore, Mentor provides features to assist 
you in refactoring RDF data and queries and make working with RDF feel more intuitive.

## Rename Local Names
In URIs the local name is the part that is different from the namespace, usually appearing after 
the last slash (/) or hash (#). For example, in the IRI `http://example.org/ns#localName`, the local 
name is `localName`.

<video class="screenshot my-3" width="500" controls autoplay muted>
 <source src="/screenshots/refactor-local-part.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

To rename the local name of a URI in the document you can simply place the cursor on it and use the 
rename symbol command (F2) to edit it like you would rename variables in other programming languages. 
Mentor will automatically update all occurrences of the local name throughout the document in both 
prefixed and unprefixed forms.

## Rename Prefixes
Prefixes are used to shorten URIs and make them more readable. For example, instead of writing
`http://example.org/ns#localName`, you can declare a prefix like `ex` and use `ex:localName` instead.

<video class="screenshot my-3" width="500" controls autoplay muted>
 <source src="/screenshots/refactor-prefix.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Renaming existing prefixes is another common refactoring task. You can select the prefix you want to 
change and use the rename symbol command (F2) to edit it. Mentor will automatically update all 
occurrences of the prefix throughout the document.

## Extract Prefixes
Mentor provides a quick way to extract the namespace portion of URIs and declare a prefix for it. When
your cursor is placed on a URI, you can use the command palette to add a new prefix declaration, and 
Mentor will automatically change all occurrences of the full URI to a prefixed name throughout the document.
