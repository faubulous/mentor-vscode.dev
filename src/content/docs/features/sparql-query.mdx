import { Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) standard query language for RDF data,
that is easily readable and familiar for SQL developers. It allows for querying and manipulating RDF graphs, making it 
a powerful tool for working with linked data.

Mentor supports you in formulating SPARQL queries through [auto-complete](/features/auto-complete) suggestions that come from the ontologies
in your workspace and also allows you to execute these queries against datasets in SPARQL endpoints, including the internal
[Workspace Index](/features/workspace-index) which effectively turns your workspace into an editable RDF graph.

There are two main ways to execute SPARQL queries in Mentor, you can either execute queries from

1. **SPARQL Documents**: You can write and execute SPARQL queries directly in the editor.
2. **Notebook Cells**: You can also execute SPARQL queries from Mentor notebook cells.

Both methods are fundamentally similar and only differ in where the query results are displayed. The fundamentals of
SPARQL query executing is covered in this document whereas the specifics of executing queries in notebook cells will be covered in the [Notebooks](/features/notebooks) section.

## Executing SPARQL Documents
You can directly execute SPARQL files from the editor. For this you either need to open an existing `.sparql` or `.rq` file or create a new one and select `SPARQL` as the language.

### Select Connection
In Mentor SPARQL queries are by default executed against the internal [Workspace triple store](/features/workspace-index). This provides
you with the ability to instantly query all the data in your workspace without any additional configuration. If you want
to query external SPARQL connections, you can configure additional SPARQL endpoints in the [connection settings](/features/connection-tree).

 <source src="/screenshots/select-sparql-connection.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The SPARQL endpoint the query will be executed against is displayed as a [Code Lens](https://vscode.rocks/codelens/) on the top of the document.
By default this will display the internal Workspace triple store, indicated by `workspace:`. To select another connection, just click on the Code Lens
and choose the desired connection from the dropdown.

### Execute Query
You can execute the query by clicking the "Run Query" button in the editor toolbar or by using the keyboard 
shortcut `Ctrl+Super` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Super` (Mac).

<video class="screenshot my-3" width="800" controls autoplay muted>
 <source src="/screenshots/sparql-query-execute.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The query status and results will then be displayed in the [SPARQL Output Panel](#sparql-output-panel).

<Aside type="note" title="Ontology Graphs">
As mentioned in the [Workspace Index](/features/workspace-index/#framework-ontologies) document, Mentor automatically loads common
RDF framework ontologies into named graphs. A feature of the [Bindings Table](#bindings-table) is that it displays IRIs with the prefixes that are either defined in the
SPARQL query or in the Mentor index. 

This means that when querying the internal Mentor graphs, you will see results like `rdf:`, `rdfs:` or `owl:` instead 
of the full graph IRIs.
</Aside>

### SPARQL Output Panel

The SPARQL Output Panel is a dedicated area in the terminal panel of Visual Studio Code. It provides an overview of
your recently executed queries and a history of all executed SPARQL queries, either queries executed from SPARQL 
documents or notebook cells.

<img class="screenshot my-3" src="/screenshots/sparql-output-panel.png" alt="Screenshot of the SPARQL Output Panel in Visual Studio Code" width="800" />

<div class="table-20ch">
| Action | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| <span class="codicon codicon-new-file"></span> *New Query* | Create a new SPARQL query document with the default template. | 
| <span class="codicon codicon-folder-opened"></span> *Open Query* | Opens a searchable pop-up menu that lists all available SPARQL query documents in the workspace. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-placeholder icon-placeholder"></span> *Clear* | Clears the query history in the output panel. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-play"></span> *Execute Query* | Executes the selected SPARQL query document. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-close"></span> *Remove Query* | Removes the selected SPARQL query document from the query history. |
| <span class="codicon codicon-screen-full"></span> *Maximise Panel* | Toggles the full-screen mode of the panel. |
</div>

## Result Views
For every executed SPARQL query, the results are shown in dedicated tabs so you can have multiple result views open at the same time and compare the results. Depending 
on the type of query, the results are displayed in different views. These are explained below.

### Bindings
For [SPARQL Select](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#select) queries, the results are returned as a set of variable bindings. 
Each binding is a mapping from a variable name to a value, and the result is typically displayed as a table.

TODO: Commands

<Aside type="tip" title="IRI Links">
In the bindings table, when you click on an IRI link, it will issue a describe query for that IRI. This allows you to quickly explore 
the details of the resource represented by the IRI. If you want to open the URL link instead, you can click on the <span class="codicon codicon-link-external"></span> icon.
</Aside>

### Boolean
For [SPARQL Ask](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#ask) queries, the result is a single boolean value 
indicating whether the query pattern was matched:

<img class="screenshot my-3" src="/screenshots/sparql-result-boolean-true.png" alt="Screenshot of a SPARQL Ask query result showing true" width="800" />
<img class="screenshot my-3" src="/screenshots/sparql-result-boolean-false.png" alt="Screenshot of a SPARQL Ask query result showing false" width="800" />

### Graph
For [SPARQL Construct](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct) or [SPARQL Describe](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#describe) queries, the result is a set of 
RDF graphs that represent the data matching the query pattern. 

<Aside type="note" title="Output Locations">
Because the results of these queries are RDF documents, the output is not displayed in the output panel. 
Depending on the execution context, the output in Turtle format is displayed in the following locations:

| Query Source | Output Location |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| *SPARQL Document* | New editor document |
| *Notebook Cell* | Cell output area |
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip">
The results of SPARQL Construct and Describe queries are RDF documents and can be explored using the 
[Definitions Tree](/features/definitions-tree).
</Aside>

### Success / Failure
For [SPARQL Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) queries, the result is a success message 
indicating that the update was applied.

## Settings
The following settings can be used to configure the behaviour of the SPARQL query feature:
