title: Syntax Highlighting
description: The developer friendly IDE for RDF knowledge graph projects.
---

Syntax highlighting enhances the readability of RDF documents by applying color coding to different syntax elements. Mentor
aligns token types with the array of RDF namespaces that are used to determine the labels for nodes in the Definitions Tree standard semantic tokens provided by Visual Studio Code to integrate seamlessly with the developer experience of 
other programming languages.
