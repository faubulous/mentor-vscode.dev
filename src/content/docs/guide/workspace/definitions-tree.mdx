The Definitions Tree provides a hierarchical view of all RDF terms that are defined 
in the active document. It allows you to quickly navigate to the definitions within 
your RDF files and execute actions on them. 

The tree shows all subjects in the current document which have an asserted `rdf:type` 
predicate and which are recognised ontology (RDFS and OWL) as well as taxonomy (SKOS) 
types. Mixing ontology and taxonomy terms in the same document is supported.

## Ontology
The tree features support for common ontology terms such as classes, properties, and 
individuals. By default, the defined terms are grouped by the ontology they are part of.
If no ontology information is available, the terms are grouped under "Unknown".

### OWL Features
To support correct display of subclass relationships, Mentor applies structural reasoning
to the ontology terms defined in the document. This means that if a class is defined as
an OWL restriction or equivalent class, Mentor will infer its subclass relationships
based on the OWL semantics.

### SHACL Features
The Definitions Tree also recognises SHACL shapes defined in the document. The tree provides
actions to navigate to shape definitions and displaying datatypes for property shapes.

## Taxonomy
The tree also supports SKOS terminology, such as concepts, concept schemes and collections. 
Similar to ontology terms, taxonomy terms are grouped by their source of definition, with 
an "Unknown" category for any terms that cannot be classified.
