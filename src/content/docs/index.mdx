Happy New Year! 🎉

This service release fixes the following bugs:

- Broken auto-complete support.
- Missing refresh icon in SPARQL boolean query results.
- `:` prefixes in files are now implemented as `workspace:` URIs instead of `file:` to improve portability.

It also adds a link to mentor-vscode.dev for help and documentation.
